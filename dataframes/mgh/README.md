* Two barcodes are dates:

  2012-10-24 17:46:33  
  2012-10-31 15:20:16

  Furthermore, in some sheets the same dates (as barcodes) are
  represented in a different format:

  2012-10-24 5:46:33 PM  
  2012-10-31 3:20:16 PM

* Two different names used for (presumably) same cell line:

  MCF10DCIS.COM  
  MCFDCIS.COM

* The concentrations should be given as the string representation of
  their log10 ('1.0', '0.5', '0.0', '-0.5', ... or '-Inf'); most of
  the digits in the full precision are meaningless here, and using
  floating point numbers (as opposed to strings) is an invitation to
  float-rounding- and formatting-related bugs.

** Can MATLAB understand `-Inf`?
