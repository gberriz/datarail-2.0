* Sheets PlateData, WellData, WellDataMapped mention two barcodes that
  are dates:

  2012-10-24 17:46:33
  2012-10-31 15:20:16

  Sheets SeededNumbers and MaxConcentr_Signal mention two barcodes
  matching the same dates, but in a slightly different format:

  2012-10-24 5:46:33 PM
  2012-10-31 3:20:16 PM

** To make matters worse, MATLAB's xlsread function interprets these
   two formats differently.

  2012-10-24 17:46:33 -> '41206.7407'
  2012-10-31 15:20:16 -> '41213.6391'

  2012-10-24 5:46:33 PM -> '2012-10-24 5:46:33 PM'
  2012-10-31 3:20:16 PM -> '2012-10-31 3:20:16 PM'


** Until we have their "true" values, these barcodes will be
   normalized to the standard ISO 8601 local time format
   yyyymmddTHHMMSS; hence

  2012-10-24 17:46:33, 2012-10-24 5:46:33 PM -> 20121024T174633  
  2012-10-31 15:20:16, 2012-10-31 3:20:16 PM -> 20121031T152016

** The row in the PlateData sheet having barcode 20121024T174633 also
   includes this in the notifications column (sic!):

    NWARNING: Plate height defined in the plate editor does not match the actual plate height. Measured height is 0.00 mm. Plate editor height is 14.83 mm. The results may be affected.|WARNING: Instrument changed the measurement height from 6.5 mm to 14.05 mm  as measurement head can't reach the given height.|WARNING: Instrument changed the measurement height from 14.05 mm to 13.85 mm  as measurement head can't reach the given height.|


* Two different names used for (presumably) same cell line:

  MCF10DCIS.COM  
  MCFDCIS.COM

* The following cell lines are missing from RefSeedSignal:

  HCC-1500
  ZR-75-30

** Consequently, the estimated_seeding_signal corresponding to these
   cell lines is NaN

* The concentrations should be given as the string representation of
  their log10 ('1.0', '0.5', '0.0', '-0.5', ... or '-Inf'); most of
  the digits in the full precision are meaningless here, and using
  floating point numbers (as opposed to strings) is an invitation to
  float-rounding- and formatting-related bugs.

** Can MATLAB understand `-Inf`?

* Most of the cell line names used in the SeededNumbers sheet have an
  extra '_HMS' suffix, not present in the corresponding cell line
  names in other sheets (e.g. WellDataMapped, RefSeedSignal).

* SeededNumbers uses 'CellLine' whereas other sheets
  (e.g. WellDataMapped) use 'Cell Name'.

* The following are the value counts for some columns of interest in
  the PlateData sheet:

  qcscore
  -------
  0        240
  10000     90
  11000      1
  10100      1

  pass_fail
  ---------
  1      240
  nan     92

  manual_flag
  -----------
  0       282
  X        44
  x         4
  #N/A      2


** Note that column manual_flag ('Manual Flag') of the sheet PlateData
   contains values that differ only in case (namely, 'x' and 'X');
   should they be regarded as equivalent?

** We need definitions for the values in the pass_fail and manual_flag
   columns (or, better yet, we need to replace the current values with
   ones having obvious meanings).
